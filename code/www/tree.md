### Spell Tree

Here you can select what class you would like to dive in ("All" means that the spells are available to all) and see what kind of spells are accessible.<br>
You can click on any node to collapse them to their parent node. For example, click on the node on the left to fully collapse the tree.<br>
You may also move the try by holding it with the mouse and zoom in/out with the scroller.
